                        <p>It is our mission to enable dog owners by giving them the necessary tools for avoiding and dealing with unwanted dog behavior. We provide hands-on dog training while giving owners an easy-to-follow structure for training and maintaining the basics in obedience and preventing or removing unwanted behaviors from the misfits. Our goal is to improve the life you and your family has with your dog.</p>

                        <h2>Method</h2>
                            <p>Our training is derived from two basic ideas: encourage things that we want and discourage things that we don't want from a dog. We believe that it is important to be clear to a dog when it has done something we wanted and when it has done something we did not want. In training and in the real world, this involves rewarding the dog for desired behaviors and correcting the dog for unwanted behaviors. There are a number of tools we use to accomplish this and will help you and your dog understand their use as well. </p>

                            <p>The 1-On-1 option is for owners who want to have a more structured approach to training their dog. Each 1-On-1 session, your dog will progress to performing the commands sit, down, place, heel, and recall and/or addressing any unwanted behaviors. Progressions can vary from dog to dog, depending on what stage their obedience and behavior is at, so we want to offer owners the most flexible options for training their dog. The ultimate goal of 1-on-1 sessions is for you and your dog to comfortably integrate into each other's daily lives.</p>

                            <p>Virtual consults are for anyone! Whether you are new to the training methods or a seasoned practitioner. Virtual consults are great if you are seeking advice on how to proceed with your dog. You might just need someone you can trust to bounce ideas off of or someone who can point you in the right direction for particular issues you are dealing with.</p>
