                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>Hey all, I'm Gabe and I live in the Reno, NV area. I have worked in many different fields, from being an enlisted operator in the military, to an engineer and a data scientist, but all of those areas had two things in common. 1. I wanted to help people as best I could with the skills I've learned 2. They required accountability to be successful. Others holding me accountable and also holding myself accountable. Without that, I never would have made it through some pretty tough days. I am here to teach you the formula for getting you and your dog where you've always wanted.</p>
