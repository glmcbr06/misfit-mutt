            <p>The 1-on-1 option is for owners who want to have a more structured approach to training their dog. Each 1-on-1 session, your dog will progress to performing the commands sit, down, place, heel, and recall. Progressions can vary from dog to dog, depending on what stage their obedience and behavior is at so we want to offer owners the most flexible options for training their dog. 1-on-1 sessions come in bundles of two sessions and four sessions. The ultimate goal of 1-on-1 sessions is for you and your dog to be comfortably integrated into each other's daily lives.</p>
